Methodology :

I) Understanding when randomness breaks any decent AI endeavour
	1) What is a brownian motion, how it is constructed
	2) Understand what is called the 'trivial forecasting' 

II) Understanding what stationnarity
	1) Longstanding modelisation needs a stable distribubtion
	2) Understanding the trade-off between getting stationar data and retraining
	3) Understanding the process of stationnarization (differentiation will cancel deterministic trend and make distribution momentums stationar)

III) Understanding the timeseries AI framework
	1) like AI in general, except we only do walk-forward validation
	2) Understanding why stationnarity will always make AI more relevant
	3) Understanding ARIMA : a simple auto regression

IV) More advanced stuff
	1) Statistical testings : stationnarity, white noise
	2) VARMA/VEC 
	3) GARCH for volatility modeling
	4) Using Prophet and other tools
